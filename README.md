# Payroll-Application

Built a payroll application using ASP.net MVC and API project templates of .net framework.  In this application the API is responsible to communicate with the database and performs all the CRUD operations directed or required by the MVC client app, while the client app is responsible to calculate the final taxed salary of an employee and display it to the user. Alertify Javascript library was used to provide notifications to the user after performing any kind of database transaction.
